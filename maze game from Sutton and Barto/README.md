TO RUN:
Unzip all files into same path!!!!
commend to run: $python .\mazegame.py

It will take a while to run. If you think it is too long you can change the total runs at line 251. It is averaging 30 attamptes. You might want it smaller. In the paper I used 20 runs to save time

map1 is the original map
map2 and map3 are the different changes of map1

if you want to try different map just make a change in line 28

alpha is reset to 0.7 to make the plot looks better. In the paper I used 0.5.
